# Migration Notes

## Commercial workspace schema 1 → 2

Schema 2 adds the persistent experiment-session foundation:

- `experiment_sessions` — mutable lifecycle/recovery projection pinned to an
  exact protocol revision;
- `experiment_session_events` — append-only lifecycle and step history; and
- `experiment_completed_steps` — append-only completed-step identities used for
  safe contiguous recovery.

### Automatic migration

`initialize_workspace_store` detects schema 1 and runs the migration in one
`BEGIN IMMEDIATE` transaction. It creates the new tables and indexes, installs
append-only triggers, replaces the legacy version metadata table, and commits
schema version 2. If any statement fails, initialization raises
`workspace_error` and does not open a partially migrated store.

The legacy `schema_metadata` definition constrained its value to exactly `1`.
For that reason the migration creates `schema_metadata_next`, inserts version 2,
drops only the old metadata table, and renames the replacement. No tenant,
membership, protocol, connector, knowledge, asset, workflow, ELN, or analytics
row is rewritten.

### Operator procedure

1. Stop all application processes using the workspace SQLite file.
2. Back up `commercial_workspace.sqlite` together with its WAL/SHM files, if
   present.
3. Start one application instance. Initialization performs the migration before
   serving workspace traffic.
4. Confirm `schema_metadata.schema_version = 2` and exercise tenant login,
   protocol library, connector listing, and experiment dashboard reads.
5. Retain the backup until the pilot acceptance suite has completed.

Downgrade is not automatic. A rollback uses the pre-migration backup; dropping
the new tables manually is not supported.
